# Chhola-Muri

A collaborative learning repository for software engineering interview preparation and knowledge sharing.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a centralized hub for our daily learning and exploration of key software engineering topics. Our focus is on building practical knowledge and skills that are commonly required in technical interviews and day-to-day engineering work.

## Areas of Focus

### Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
- Implementation of common data structures
- Algorithm techniques and patterns
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Problem-solving approaches

### System Design
- Distributed systems architecture
- Scalability patterns
- High-availability strategies
- Microservices design
- Database selection and optimization
- URL shortener and other practical examples

### Software Development Processes
- Agile methodologies
- Testing strategies
- CI/CD pipelines
- Code review practices
- DevOps principles

### Linux & Operating Systems
- Command-line tools and utilities
- Shell scripting
- System administration
- Performance monitoring and optimization

## Repository Structure

Each major topic has its own dedicated directory with relevant implementations, notes, and resources:

- `/dsa` - Data structures and algorithms implementations and problems
- `/system_design` - System design case studies and architecture diagrams
- `/linux` - Linux scripts, commands, and references
- `/process` - Documentation on software development processes

## Team Members

This repository is maintained by:
- Andalib
- Selim
- Habib
- Lenin
- Opu
- Shemul
