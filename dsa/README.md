# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

This directory contains implementations, practice problems, and notes related to Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Purpose

- Strengthen understanding of fundamental data structures
- Practice algorithm design and implementation
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Analyze time and space complexity

## Directory Structure

- `/arrays` - Array-based problems and techniques
- `/linked_lists` - Linked list implementations and problems
- `/trees` - Tree data structures (binary, BST, AVL, etc.)
- `/graphs` - Graph algorithms and problems
- `/dynamic_programming` - Dynamic programming solutions
- `/sorting` - Sorting algorithms and their analysis
- `/searching` - Searching algorithms and their applications
- `/hash_tables` - Hash table implementations and problems
- `/heaps` - Heap data structure and related problems
- `/recursion` - Recursive algorithm examples

## Approach to Problems

Each problem should include:
1. Problem statement
2. Approach and thought process
3. Solution with clean, well-documented code
4. Time and space complexity analysis
5. Alternative approaches (if applicable)
