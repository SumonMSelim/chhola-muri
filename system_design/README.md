# System Design

This directory contains system design case studies, architectural patterns, and practical implementations of distributed systems.

## Purpose

- Document practical system design approaches
- Explore scalable architecture patterns
- Study real-world distributed systems
- Prepare for system design interviews
- Implement working examples of common systems

## Directory Structure

- `/url_shortner` - Complete URL shortener design and implementation
- `/rate_limiter` - Rate limiting service design and implementation
- `/distributed_cache` - Distributed caching system
- `/notification_service` - Scalable notification system
- `/payment_processing` - Payment processing system architecture
- `/data_pipelines` - Big data processing pipelines
- `/search_engine` - Search engine architecture
- `/social_network` - Social network design patterns
- `/patterns` - Common architectural patterns

## Approach to System Design

Each system design project should include:
1. Problem statement and requirements
2. Constraints and assumptions
3. API design
4. Data model
5. High-level architecture
6. Detailed component design
7. Database schema
8. Scaling considerations
9. Performance optimizations
10. Implementation (when applicable)

## Design Principles

- Start with simple, working designs
- Scale incrementally as needed
- Consider tradeoffs explicitly
- Document design decisions and their rationale
- Favor decoupled, modular components
- Plan for failures at all levels

## Common Considerations

- Availability and consistency tradeoffs
- Caching strategies
- Load balancing approaches
- Replication patterns
- Sharding techniques
- Message queues and event-driven design
- Monitoring and observability
- Security and data privacy
